  abstract={The future LISA detector will constitute the prime instrument for high-precision gravitational wave observations. Among other goals, LISA is expected to materialize a 'spacetime-mapping' program that is to provide information for the properties of spacetime in the vicinity of supermassive black holes which reside in the majority of galactic nuclei. Such black holes can capture stellar-mass compact objects, which afterwards slowly inspiral under the emission of gravitational radiation. The small body's orbital motion and the associated waveform observed at infinity carry information about the spacetime metric of the massive black hole, and in principle it is possible to extract this information and experimentally identify (or not!) a Kerr black hole. In this paper we lay the foundations for a practical spacetime-mapping framework. Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not necessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is stationary axisymmetric, described by a metric which deviates slightly from the known Kerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a 'quasi-Kerr' metric by adding to the Kerr metric the leading order deviation which appears in the value of the spacetime's quadrupole moment. We then study geodesic motion of a test body in this metric, mainly focusing on equatorial orbits, but also providing equations describing generic orbits formulated by means of canonical perturbation theory techniques. We proceed by computing approximate 'kludge' gravitational waveforms which we compare with their Kerr counterparts. We find that a modest deviation from the Kerr metric is sufficient for producing a significant mismatch between the waveforms, provided we fix the orbital parameters. This result suggests that an attempt to use Kerr waveform templates for studying extreme mass ratio inspirals around a non-Kerr object might result in serious loss of signal-to-noise ratio and total number of detected events. The waveform comparisons also unveil a 'confusion' problem, that is the possibility of matching a true non-Kerr waveform with a Kerr template of different orbital parameters.}

	abstract={The dynamical parameters conventionally used to specify the orbit of a test particle in Kerr spacetime are the energy E , the axial component of the angular momentum, L z , and Carter's constant Q . These parameters are obtained by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the dynamical problem of geodesic motion. Employing the action-angle variable formalism, on the other hand, yields a different set of constants of motion, namely, the fundamental frequencies ω r , ω θ and ω ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} associated with the radial, polar and azimuthal components of orbital motion, respectively. These frequencies, naturally, determine the time scales of orbital motion and, furthermore, the instantaneous gravitational wave spectrum in the adiabatic approximation. In this paper, it is shown that the fundamental frequencies are geometric invariants and explicit formulae in terms of quadratures are derived. The numerical evaluation of these formulae in the case of a rapidly rotating black hole illustrates the behaviour of the fundamental frequencies as orbital parameters, such as the semi-latus rectum p , the eccentricity e or the inclination parameter θ − are varied. The limiting cases of circular, equatorial and Keplerian motion are investigated as well and it is shown that known results are recovered from the general formulae.}
