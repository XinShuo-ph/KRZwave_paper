	abstract={We present the first X-ray reflection model for testing the assumption that the metric of astrophysical black holes is described by the Kerr solution. We employ the formalism of the transfer function proposed by Cunningham. The calculations of the reflection spectrum of a thin accretion disk are split into two parts: the calculation of the transfer function and the calculation of the local spectrum at any emission point in the disk. The transfer function only depends on the background metric and takes into account all the relativistic effects (gravitational redshift, Doppler boosting, and light bending). Our code computes the transfer function for a spacetime described by the Johannsen metric and can easily be extended to any stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically flat spacetime. Transfer functions and single line shapes in the Kerr metric are compared to those calculated from existing codes to check that we reach the necessary accuracy. We also simulate some observations with NuSTAR and LAD/eXTP and fit the data with our new model to show the potential capabilities of current and future observations to constrain possible deviations from the Kerr metric.}

	abstract={Although general relativity (GR) has been tested extensively in the weak-gravity regime, similar tests in the strong-gravity regime are still missing. In this paper, we explore the possibility to use X-ray spectropolarimetric observations of black holes in X-ray binaries to distinguish between the Kerr metric and the phenomenological metrics introduced by Johannsen & Psaltis (which are not vacuum solutions of Einstein's equation) and thus to test the no-hair theorem of GR. To this end, we have developed a numerical code that calculates the radial brightness profiles of accretion disks and parallel transports the wave vector and polarization vector of photons through the Kerr and non-GR spacetimes. We used the code to predict the observational appearance of GR and non-GR accreting black hole systems. We find that the predicted energy spectra and energy-dependent polarization degree and polarization direction do depend strongly on the underlying spacetime. However, for large regions of the parameter space, the GR and non-GR metrics lead to very similar observational signatures, making it difficult to observationally distinguish between the two types of models.}

	abstract={According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are fully characterized by their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric. This theorem can be tested observationally by measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of black holes. In this paper, we calculate the profiles of fluorescent iron lines emitted from the accretion flows around black hole candidates within a framework that allows us to perform the calculation as a function of its mass and spin as well as of a free parameter that measures potential deviations from the Kerr metric. We show that such deviations lead to line profiles that are significantly altered and may exhibit a modified flux ratio of the two peaks in their characteristic double-peaked shape. We also show that the disk inclination can be measured independently of the spin and the deviation parameter at low to intermediate inclination angles, as in the case of Kerr black holes. We estimate the precision that near-future X-ray missions such as Astro-H and ATHENA + are required to achieve in order to resolve deviations from the Kerr metric in iron line profiles and show that constraints on such deviations will be strongest for rapidly spinning black holes. More generally, we show that measuring the line profile with a precision of ~5\% at disk inclinations of 30° or 60° constrains the deviation parameter to order unity for values of the spin a ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 0.5 M .}

To enhance the scope of this emergent field of science, we pioneered the use of deep learning with convolutional neural networks, that take time-series inputs, for rapid detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals. This approach, Deep Filtering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this article, we present the extension of Deep Filtering using real data from LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using continuous data streams from multiple LIGO detectors. We demonstrate for the first time that machine learning can detect and estimate the true parameters of real events observed by LIGO. Our results show that Deep Filtering achieves similar sensitivities and lower errors compared to matched-filtering while being far more computationally efficient and more resilient to glitches, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This unified framework for data analysis is ideally suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time."

Due to their complicated nature and weak amplitudes the detection and parameter estimation of such sources is a challenging task. In this paper we present a statistical methodology based on Bayesian inference in which the estimation of parameters is carried out by advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms such as parallel tempering MCMC. We analysed high and medium mass EMRI systems that fall well inside the low frequency range of LISA. In the context of the Mock LISA Data Challenges, our investigation and results are also the first instance in which a fully Markovian algorithm is applied for EMRI searches. Results show that our algorithm worked well in recovering EMRI signals from different (simulated) LISA data sets having single and multiple EMRI sources and holds great promise for posterior computation under more realistic conditions. The search and estimation methods presented in this paper are general in their nature, and can be applied in any other scenario such as AdLIGO, AdVIRGO and Einstein Telescope with their respective response functions.}

In this paper a variant of the well studied ‘analytic kludge’ model for EMRIs around Kerr black holes is extended to a family of parametrically deformed bumpy black holes which preserve the basic symmetries of the Kerr metric.

	abstract={The spacetime geometry around astrophysical black holes is supposed to be well approximated by the Kerr metric, but deviations from the Kerr solution are predicted in a number of scenarios involving new physics. Broad iron Kα lines are commonly observed in the X-ray spectrum of black holes and originate by X-ray fluorescence of the inner accretion disk. The profile of the iron line is sensitively affected by the spacetime geometry in the strong gravity region and can be used to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In this paper, we extend previous work in the literature. In particular: i ) as test-metric, we employ the parametrization recently proposed by Konoplya, Rezzolla, and Zhidenko, which has a number of subtle advantages with respect to the existing approaches; ii ) we perform simulations with specific X-ray missions, and we consider NuSTAR as a prototype of current observational facilities and eXTP as an example of the next generation of X-ray observatories. We find a significant difference between the constraining power of NuSTAR and eXTP. With NuSTAR, it is difficult or impossible to constrain deviations from the Kerr metric. With eXTP, in most cases we can obtain quite stringent constraints (modulo we have the correct astrophysical model).}

  abstract={The future LISA detector will constitute the prime instrument for high-precision gravitational wave observations. Among other goals, LISA is expected to materialize a 'spacetime-mapping' program that is to provide information for the properties of spacetime in the vicinity of supermassive black holes which reside in the majority of galactic nuclei. Such black holes can capture stellar-mass compact objects, which afterwards slowly inspiral under the emission of gravitational radiation. The small body's orbital motion and the associated waveform observed at infinity carry information about the spacetime metric of the massive black hole, and in principle it is possible to extract this information and experimentally identify (or not!) a Kerr black hole. In this paper we lay the foundations for a practical spacetime-mapping framework. Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not necessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is stationary axisymmetric, described by a metric which deviates slightly from the known Kerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a 'quasi-Kerr' metric by adding to the Kerr metric the leading order deviation which appears in the value of the spacetime's quadrupole moment. We then study geodesic motion of a test body in this metric, mainly focusing on equatorial orbits, but also providing equations describing generic orbits formulated by means of canonical perturbation theory techniques. We proceed by computing approximate 'kludge' gravitational waveforms which we compare with their Kerr counterparts. We find that a modest deviation from the Kerr metric is sufficient for producing a significant mismatch between the waveforms, provided we fix the orbital parameters. This result suggests that an attempt to use Kerr waveform templates for studying extreme mass ratio inspirals around a non-Kerr object might result in serious loss of signal-to-noise ratio and total number of detected events. The waveform comparisons also unveil a 'confusion' problem, that is the possibility of matching a true non-Kerr waveform with a Kerr template of different orbital parameters.}

These parameters are obtained by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the dynamical problem of geodesic motion. Employing the action-angle variable formalism, on the other hand, yields a different set of constants of motion, namely, the fundamental frequencies ω r , ω θ and ω ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} associated with the radial, polar and azimuthal components of orbital motion, respectively. These frequencies, naturally, determine the time scales of orbital motion and, furthermore, the instantaneous gravitational wave spectrum in the adiabatic approximation. In this paper, it is shown that the fundamental frequencies are geometric invariants and explicit formulae in terms of quadratures are derived. The numerical evaluation of these formulae in the case of a rapidly rotating black hole illustrates the behaviour of the fundamental frequencies as orbital parameters, such as the semi-latus rectum p , the eccentricity e or the inclination parameter θ − are varied. The limiting cases of circular, equatorial and Keplerian motion are investigated as well and it is shown that known results are recovered from the general formulae.}
